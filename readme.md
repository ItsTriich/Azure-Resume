# Travis's Azure Resume

This is my Cloud Resume Challenge built on Azure. Its a static website hosted on an Azure Static Web APP, with a visitor counter built on Azure Functions that updates and stores the view count persistantly in a CosmoDB database. The website is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The visitor counter is built with .NET 8 and Azure Functions.

This repo is used as a starter for a _very basic_ HTML web application using no front-end frameworks.

This repo has a dev container. This means if you open it inside a [GitHub Codespace](https://github.com/features/codespaces), or using [VS Code with the remote containers extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers), it will be opened inside a container with all the dependencies already installed.
