# Travis's Azure Resume

This is my Cloud Resume Challenge built on Azure. Its a static website hosted on an Azure Static Web App, with a visitor counter built on Azure Functions that updates and stores the view count persistantly in a CosmoDB database. The website is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The visitor counter is built with .NET 8 and Azure Functions.
